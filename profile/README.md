# Who are we?

A group of developers, builder and artists working to create new experiences for Minecraft players. Our goal is to show people what can be made possible in the lastest versions of the game.

## Our achievements

`Sorry there is nothing to share yet... :(`

## Get to know our team

Our team is gathered from all around the world! Since we aim to make this project as accessible as possible, for everyone anywhere, we do not limit our players and members to any country.

#### Meet our creator
Viktor "rotzZ" Čierňava, young developer who has spend years on Minecraft development alone, started this project in Czech Republic with nothing else than just a vision.
